	abstract = {We present a framework for tracking and visualizing the evolution of cyclones which we organize in hierarchical groups. Our approach is based on the general concept of critical point tracking and supports the exploration of resulting tracks in a level of detail approach. The problem of tracking and visualizing cyclones is still an active area of climate research, since the nature of cyclones varies depending on geospatial location and temporal season, resulting in no clear mathematical definition. Consequently, many methods contain multiple parameters used to distinguish cyclones of interest but do not work for general cyclone extraction across the globe. Our pipeline consists of four modular building blocks: (1) a novel critical point tracking method, used in a time-varying scalar field, (2) defining cyclonic features as groups of critical points based on merge-tree crown components, (3) tracking features and creating the hierarchy between them and (4) a hierarchical visualization of features containing a global abstract representation linked to a spatial embedding, allowing exploration on a global and local scale. The modularity of the pipeline allows each independent block to be exchanged with another method conforming to expected input and output.  We demonstrate that our method is not limited to the specifics of cyclone tracking and can be used in other application areas.},

@article{Thygesen2021,
	abstract = {We present a framework for the exploration and analysis of ensembles of transition diagrams, where a transition diagram describes the change of distribution between two different states.  Specifically we are interested in electronic transitions in a molecule. Such transitions can be divided into local excitation - the electron density field is similar before and after the transition, and charge transfer - the electron density distribution shifts from one part to another part of the molecule during the electronic transition. It is of high interest to distinguish between these types of transitions when developing a better understanding of the interaction between materials and light on a molecular level.One challenge is to compare such electronic transitions, both between different excited states of the same molecule (for one or several conformations) but also between different molecule ensembles. In this paper, we propose a way to explore an ensemble of electronic transitions by representing the transition with a feature vector and applying dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering to group similar transitions together. We introduce a mean transition diagram to represent a cluster of transitions, shown at different level of detail depending on available space. The implementation is done in an interactive tool, allowing the user to explore similar transitions at different levels of the cluster hierarchy.},

	abstract = {The study of electronic transitions within a molecule connected to the absorption or emission of light is a common task in the process of the design of new materials. The transitions are complex quantum mechanical processes and a detailed analysis requires a breakdown of these processes into components that can be interpreted via characteristic chemical properties. We approach these tasks by providing a detailed analysis of the electron density field. This entails methods to quantify and visualize electron localization and transfer from molecular subgroups combining spatial and abstract representations. The core of our method uses geometric segmentation of the electronic density field coupled with a graph theoretic formulation of charge transfer between molecular subgroups. The design of the methods has been guided by the goal of providing a generic and objective analysis following fundamental concepts. We illustrate the proposed approach using several case studies involving the study of electronic transitions in different molecular systems.},

	abstract = {We study with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation the stability of a discontinuity or piston, which separates an electron--positron cloud from a cooler electron--proton plasma. Such a piston might be present in the relativistic jets of accreting black holes separating the jet material from the surrounding ambient plasma and when pair clouds form during an x-ray flare and expand into the plasma of the accretion disk corona. We inject a pair plasma at a simulation boundary with a mildly relativistic temperature and mean speed. It flows across a spatially uniform electron--proton plasma, which is permeated by a background magnetic field. The magnetic field is aligned with one simulation direction and oriented orthogonally to the mean velocity vector of the pair cloud. The expanding pair cloud expels the magnetic field and piles it up at its front. It is amplified to a value large enough to trap ambient electrons. The },

	abstract = {Oceanic eddies, which are highly mass-coherent vortices traveling through the earth's waters, are of special interest for their mixing properties. Therefore, large-scale ensemble simulations are performed to approximate their possible evolution. Analyz- ing their development and transport behavior requires a stable extraction of both their shape and properties of water masses within. We present a framework for extracting the time series of full 3D eddy geometries based on an winding angle criterion. Our analysis tools enables users to explore the results in-depth by linking extracted volumes to extensive statistics collected across several ensemble members. The methods are showcased on an ensemble simulation of the Red Sea. We show that our extraction produces stable and coherent geometries even for highly irregular eddies in the Red Sea. These capabilities are utilized to evaluate the stability of our method with respect to variations of user-defined parameters. Feedback gathered from domain experts was very positive and indicates that our methods will be considered for newly simulated, even larger data sets.},

@article{Behrendt2021,
	abstract = {Rupture risk assessment is a key to devise patient-specific treatment plans of cerebral aneurysms. To understand and predict the development of aneurysms and other vascular diseases over time, both hemodynamic flow patterns and their effect on the vessel surface need to be analyzed. Flow structures close to the vessel wall often correlate directly with local changes in surface parameters, such as pressure or wall shear stress. However, especially for the identification of specific blood flow characteristics that cause local startling parameters on the vessel surface, like elevated pressure values, an interactive analysis tool is missing. In order to find meaningful structures in the entirety of the flow, the data has to be filtered based on the respective explorative aim. Thus, we present a combination of visualization, filtering and interaction techniques for explorative analysis of blood flow with a focus on the relation of local surface parameters and underlying flow structures. In combination with a filtering-based approach, we propose the usage of evolutionary algorithms to reduce the overhead of computing pathlines that do not contribute to the analysis, while simultaneously reducing the undersampling artifacts. We present clinical cases to demonstrate the benefits of both our filter-based and evolutionary approach and showcase its potential for patient-specific treatment plans.},

In general, junior researchers might be more affected, but this is a choice that all levels of academic seniority face. Our panel targets an open discussion on the active choice of ``staying or leaving'' and its reasons, on the positives and negatives of both possible paths (academia vs. industry), and on how we, as a community, can foster a healthier environment to support and equip our members---whether they decide to stay in academia, or not. Our choice of panelists (Silvia Miksch, Johanna Beyer, Chuck Hansen, Jan Reininghaus, Bei Wang and Jack van Wijk) pays attention to the inclusion of researchers from different academic ages and with different paths, to reflect different career and life challenges. We have ensured gender balance among our panelists, as female researchers often face different (and additional) challenges, and we have included a panelist from industry, to represent both sides of the coin. We anticipate that our panel will engage a large group of researchers at different career stages in a lively discussion to shape our community.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework that fully leverages the advantages of a deferred rendering approach for the interactive visualization of large-scale datasets. Geometry buffers (G-Buffers) are generated and stored in situ, and shading is performed post hoc in an interactive image-based rendering front end. This decoupled framework has two major advantages. First, the G-Buffers only need to be computed and stored once - which corresponds to the most expensive part of the rendering pipeline. Second, the stored G-Buffers can later be consumed in an image-based rendering front end that enables users to interactively adjust various visualization parameters - such as the applied color map or the strength of ambient occlusion - where suitable choices are often not known a priori. This paper demonstrates the use of Cinema Darkroom on several real-world datasets, highlighting CD's ability to effectively decouple the complexity and size of the dataset from its visualization.},

	abstract = {High pressure chemistry is known to inspire the creation of unexpected new classes of compounds with exceptional properties. Here we employ laser-heated diamond anvil cell technique for synthesis of a Dirac material, BeN4. A triclinic phase of beryllium tetranitride tr-BeN4 was synthesized from elements at ~85 GPa. Upon decompression to ambient conditions, it transforms into a compound with atomic-thick BeN4 layers interconnected via weak van der Waals bonds consisting of polyacetylene-like nitrogen chains with conjugated π-systems and Be atoms in square-planar coordination. Theoretical calculations for a single BeN4 layer show that its electronic lattice is described by a slightly distorted honeycomb structure reminiscent of the graphene lattice and the presence of Dirac points in the electronic band structure at the Fermi level. The BeN4 layer, i.e. beryllonitrene, represents a qualitatively new class of 2D materials that can be built of a metal atom and polymeric nitrogen chains and host anisotropic Dirac fermions. \newline The use of non-conventional methods of materials synthesis or established synthesis techniques in a non-trivial way may lead to breakthrough discoveries that revolutionize many research fields. One of the most striking examples is graphene. It was considered as an interesting two-dimensional (2D) model, though predominantly theoretical, before high quality graphitic films were derived by Novoselov et al. by mechanical exfoliation of small mesas of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite using adhesive tape [1]. Graphene is a material with gapless Dirac cones near the Fermi level with a linear energy-momentum dispersion near the Dirac points, and exhibiting ultrahigh carrier mobility. While the Dirac cones in graphene and many other 2D compounds are isotropic, their anisotropy could result in anisotropic carrier mobility, making it possible to realize direction-dependent quantum devices and motivating intense search for materials systems hosting the anisotropic Dirac cones. Experimental evidences of anisotropic Dirac fermions have been reported in bulk stoichiometric PtTe2 single crystal[2] and in 2D material borophene [3]. However, the Dirac point in these materials is far from the Fermi energy. A cone with its apex located near the Fermi level has been observed in BaFe2As2 [4], though the anisotropy was weak. There were theoretical predictions for the organic conductor ... at high pressure [5] and a B2S honeycomb monolayer [6]. There are proposals to achieve desired anisotropy using mechanical stress, external periodic potentials, heterostructures, or by a strong laser field [5--11]. However, experimental realization of a material hosting strongly anisotropic Dirac fermions at the Fermi energy is limited to a few examples [12,13] and calls for novel synthetic approaches.},

	abstract = {In molecular analysis, Spatial Distribution Functions (SDF) are fundamental instruments in answering questions related to spatial occurrences and relations of atomic structures over time. Given a molecular trajectory, SDFs can, for example, reveal the occurrence of water in relation to particular structures and hence provide clues of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. For the computation of meaningful distribution functions, the definition of molecular reference structures is essential. Therefore we introduce the concept of an internal frame of reference (IFR) for labeled point sets that represent selected molecular structures, and we propose an algorithm for tracking the IFR over time and space using a variant of Kabsch's algorithm. This approach lets us generate a consistent space for the aggregation of the SDF for molecular trajectories and molecular ensembles. We demonstrate the usefulness of the technique by applying it to temporal molecular trajectories as well as ensemble datasets. The examples include different docking scenarios with DNA, insulin, and aspirin.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play an important role in understanding oceanic transport, e.g., of heat, pollution and biomass, which is of special interest in the Red Sea. Thereby, the analysis of transport structures relies on large-scale ensemble simulations of ocean flows, leaving the domain scientist with a vast amount of data to be explored. Such an ensemble data set, together with four analysis tasks, is the basis for the SciVis Contest 2020. In this submission, we present our solutions to approach these tasks. When designing our methods, the main goal was to rely on a simple concept and parameters that can easily be communicated to the domain scientist. With this in mind, we decided to implement direct methods as well as a geometric approach searching for 'almost-closed streamlines' using a winding angle criterion. The resulting streamlines are then clustered over space and time, resulting in stacks of three-dimensional volumes representing the eddies. Due to the explicit geometric extraction of eddies, quantitative measures can be computed. These include a multitude of statistical measures, e.g. size, average temperature, and salinity. Using linked, coordinated views with statistical representations and three-dimensional visualizations our system supports spatio-temporal exploration and filtering of the data. Our method has been implemented in the open-source framework Inviwo [1]. Additionally, a video demonstrating the capabilities of the method is submitted as supplementary material.},

Facilitating easy-to-use, interactive exploration and analysis of cyclones can serve as a useful tool to support domain scientists in their research. We present a framework for tracking and visualizing multi- center cyclones, which takes into account cyclones which merge and split over their lifetime. All parts of our framework allow interaction by domain scientists: the algorithm for computing the tracking graph, selections of individual cyclone tracks and the parameters used for visualizing the results. A cyclonic region defines the spread and boundary of a cyclone and over time, the pressure within the region changes. Therefore, a cyclone cannot be represented by an iso-surface in three dimensions and instead, we segment a volume by region growing from the track of the cyclone and finally, extracting a surface around the cyclonic region. We offer multiple criteria for this algorithm, allowing the domain scientist to explore and visually analyze the data. Furthermore, we enable an easy overview of the cyclone time series by mapping time to the third dimension.},

	abstract = {Frequency distributions (FD) are an important instrument when analyzing and investigating scientific data. In volumetric visualization, for example, frequency distributions visualized as histograms, often assist the user in the process of designing transfer function (TF) primitives. Yet a single point in the distribution can correspond to multiple features in the data, particularly in low-dimensional TFs that dominate time-critical domains such as health care. In this paper, we propose contributions to the area of medical volume data exploration, in particular Computed Tomography (CT) data, based on the decomposition of local frequency distributions (LFD). By considering the local neighborhood utilizing LFDs we can incorporate a measure for neighborhood similarity to differentiate features thereby enhancing the classification abilities of existing methods. This also allows us to link the attribute space of the histogram with the spatial properties of the data to improve the user experience and simplify the exploration step. We propose three approaches for data exploration which we illustrate with several visualization cases highlighting distinct features that are not identifiable when considering only the global frequency distribution. We demonstrate the power of the method on selected datasets.

@article{Yan2020-R,
	abstract = { Merge trees, a type of topological descriptors for scalar fields, serve to identify and summarize the topological characteristics associated with a data instance. They present a great potential for the analysis and visualization of ensembles, that is, collections of data instances that arise from multiple simulation runs, different parameter settings, or time-varying observations. First, they provide compressed and topology-preserving representations of ensemble members. Second, their comparison provides a basis for studying the relations among ensemble members, such as their distributions, averages, clusters, outliers, and periodicities. Some comparative metrics have been developed for merge trees including functional distortion distance, Gromov--Hausdorff distance, and edit distance. However, these metrics are often computationally expensive since they implicitly consider all possible correspondences between critical points of the merge trees without integrating geometric information from the data domain. In this paper, we perform geometry and topology aware comparisons of merge trees. The main idea is to decouple the computation of a comparative metric into two steps: a labeling step that generates a correspondence between the critical points of two merge trees, and a distance computation step that computes distances between a pair of labeled merge trees by encoding them as matrices. We show that our approach is both computationally efficient and practically useful. Our general framework makes it possible to integrate both geometric and topological information of the data domain in the labeling process. At the same time, it reduces the computational complexity significantly since not all possible correspondences have to be considered. We provide several heuristic strategies for the labeling of critical points in a merge tree. We also investigate various theoretical properties of distance metrics that may be desirable to merge tree metrics. We further provide an interactive visualization system that demonstrates the utility of our framework across a set of scalar field ensembles.},

	abstract = {While volume rendering for scalar fields has been advanced into a powerful visualisation method, similar volumetric representations for tensor fields are still rare. The complexity of the data challenges not only the rendering but also the design of the transfer function. In this paper we propose an interface using glyph widgets to design a transfer function for the rendering of tensor data sets. Thereby the transfer function (TF) controls a volume rendering which represents sought after tensor-features and a texture that convey directional information. The basis of the design interface is a two-dimensional projection of the feature space. Characteristic representatives in the form of glyphs support an intuitive navigation through the feature space. We provide three different options to select the representatives: automatic selection based on feature space clustering, uniform sampling of the feature space, or manually selected representatives. In contrast to glyphs placed into the 3D volume, we use glyphs with complex geometry as widgets to control the shape and extent of the representatives. In the final rendering the glyphs with their assigned colors play a similar role as a legend in an atlas like representation. The method provides an overview of the tensor field in the 3D volume at the same time as it allows the user to explore the tensor field in a feature space. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach on tensor fields for selected data sets with very different characteristics.

	abstract = {Fundamentally, data visualization is the process of placing dabs of ink or color on a 2D plane. However, the complexity of data is increasing so that we see large numbers of instances, dimensions, parameters, etc. Such data surpasses what can readily be shown on a 2D or 3D display. One solution to this challenge is the development of better or more complex interfaces, that include, for instance, linked views, large displays, dynamic visualizations, and sophisticated user interactions. The alternative and complementary approach is to develop sets of mathematical and statistical tools to transform, map, or summarize data and thereby reduce its complexity so that visualization and understanding of large and complex becomes more feasible. The role of visualization research, in this case, is to identify common use cases and develop methods and tools that can readily be adapted to particular applications. If we consider the terminology proposed by Munzner, there is a high-level discussion of reducing items and attributes and associated visualization conventions and practices. Here we take deeper (and complementary) look at the analytical frameworks and approaches for transforming data into forms that are appropriate for display devices, considered generally. The approach in this chapter is to begin by characterizing different types of data in a way that is well suited for this discussion. We will then focus on a few particular classes of data and different ways of summarizing and transforming data of those types. Finally, we will broaden the discussion to other types of data and how they map into the various methodologies.},

In this chapter, we sample the visualization literature to provide a taxonomy of the usage of mathematics in visualization, and to identify a fundamental set of mathematics that should be taught to students as part of an introduction to contemporary visualization research. Within the scope of this chapter, we are unable to provide a full review of all mathematical foundations of visualization; rather, we identify a number of concepts that are useful in visualization, explain their significance, and provide references for further reading.

@inproceedings{Behrendt2019,
	abstract = {Blood flow simulations play an important role for the understanding of vascular diseases, such as aneurysms. However, analysis of the resulting flow patterns, especially comparisons across patient groups, are challenging. Typically, the hemodynamic analysis relies on trial and error inspection of the flow data based on pathline visualizations and surface renderings. Visualizing too many pathlines at once may obstruct interesting features, e.g. embedded vortices, whereas showing too little pathlines may lead to a missing of particularities, e.g. flow characteristics in aneurysm blebs. While filtering and clustering techniques can help to ease this task, they require the pre-computation of pathlines densely sampled in the space-time domain. Not only does this become prohibitively expensive for large patient groups, but the results often suffer from undersampling artifacts. In this work, we propose the usage of evolutionary algorithms to reduce the overhead of computing pathlines that do not contribute to the analysis, while simultaneously reducing the undersampling artifacts. Integrated in an interactive framework, it efficiently supports the evaluation of hemodynamics for clinical research and treatment planning in cerebral aneurysms. The specification of general optimization criteria for entire patient groups allows the blood flow data to be batch-processed. We present clinical cases to demonstrate the benefits of our approach especially in presence of aneurysm blebs. Furthermore, we conducted an evaluation with four expert neuroradiologists. As a result, we report advantages of our method for treatment planning to underpin its clinical benefit.},

	abstract = {We present an application, and its development process, for interactive visual analysis of brain imaging data and clinical measurements. The application targets neuroscientists interested in understanding the correlations between active brain regions and physiological or psychological factors. The application has been developed in a participatory design process and has subsequently been released as the free software `VisualNeuro'. From initial observations of the neuroscientists' workflow, we concluded that while existing tools provide powerful analysis options, they lack effective interactive exploration requiring the use of many tools side by side. Consequently, our application has been designed to simplify the workflow combining statistical analysis with interactive visual exploration. The resulting environment comprises parallel coordinates for effective overview and selection, Welch's t-test to filter out brain regions with statistically significant differences and multiple visualizations for comparison between brain regions and clinical parameters. These exploration concepts enable neuroscientists to interactively explore the complex bidirectional interplay between clinical and brain measurements and easily compare different patient groups. A qualitative user study has been performed with three neuroscientists from different domains. The study shows that the developed environment supports simultaneous analysis of more parameters, provides rapid pathways to insights, and is an effective tool for hypothesis formation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a concept to design, track and compare application- specific topology-based features as a set of critical points. Our work has been inspired by the observation that in many applications a large variety of feature definitions are used. Furthermore, it is often unclear which definition should be used in which con- text. Often, these features can be related to topological concepts, including extremal structures. Given this, we focus on features spanned by sets of critical points. In our approach, we separate the topological analysis and the critical point tracking from the feature design and thus facilitate a means for interactive feature comparison. The backbone of our tracking method is a precomputed tracking graph which stores all extremal points as well as their temporal corespondents. In addition, features are specified by rules for grouping critical points and represented by a respective area in the geometric embedding. Now, feature tracking corresponds to filtering and querying the full tracking graph by specific requests. We demonstrate this method for cyclone identification and tracking in the context of climate research.},

	abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art report on time-dependent flow topology. We survey representative papers in visualization and provide a taxonomy of existing approaches that generalize flow topology from time-independent to time-dependent settings. The approaches are classified based upon four categories: tracking of steady topology, reference frame adaption, pathline classification or clustering, and generalization of critical points. Our unique contributions include introducing a set of desirable mathematical properties to interpret physical meaningfulness for time-dependent flow visualization, inferring mathematical properties associated with selective research papers, and utilizing such properties for classification. The five most important properties we surveyed in the existing literature include coincidence with the steady case, induction of a partition within the domain, Lagrangian invariance, objectivity, and Galilean invariance.},

@proceedings{Hanson2020,
	abstract = {VISUAL COMMUNICATION CAN provide a method to make information known or understandable to the general public. Visual communication in public spaces, such as museums, science centers, and mainstream media, is gaining momentum driven by the success of interactive visualization in exploration of scientific data. We are now seeing different installations and specific tools to convey knowledge through interactive and exploratory visual communication in a wide variety of settings. For this Special Issue, we solicited papers describing work based on visualization in public spaces from both a technology and methodology perspective. Through the formal IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications review pro- cess of the 11 submissions, we accepted four papers for this Special Issue spanning installations in museums to technical methods for generating content for public spaces. These papers demonstrate the breadth of techniques for visualization in public spaces. \newline In Illustrating Changes in Time-Series Data With Data Video, Lu and coauthors describe how to support interactive detection and depiction of hanges in time-series for data videos. Data videos were widely used for visualization in public spaces, such as news, displays at libraries and museums, and applications on mobile devices. By providing a visual interface, effective editing of data videos, including time-series information, can be accomplished. Such data videos contribute strongly to visualization in public spaces. \newline A science center installation about nano- science and nanotechnology is described in ``Nano for the Public: An Exploranation Perspective. Palmerius and Sch{\"o}nborn take an exploranation perspective through a retrospective analysis of the NanoSim exhibit. In this analysis, they describe the combination of three distinct, yet synergistic components: Data Visualization, Interactivity, and Science Communication as expressing exploranation. These three components, when simultaneously active, form ``distinct exploranative learning events. The retrospective pro- vides several insights about these components that would help future exhibits using visualization in public spaces. \newline Exploring the Martian terrain and information using augmented reality is the focus for the MarsCAPE system: Mars Communicated Through an Augmented, Physical Environment. The project is based on the use of a selected number of physical models of the surface of Mars, and visual representations of information are then projected onto the three-dimensional models. The article describes evaluations conducted to assess learning and engagement values and the outcome reported is a significant increase in knowledge, engagement, and natural learning. The paper is a novel approach to letting members of the general public have access planetary data that goes beyond the capabilities of on-screen visualizations. \newline PixelClipper is a system designed to encourage event visitors to interact with visualizations in public settings and stimulate discussion on the data and the visualizations. The system includes a set of tools that allow visitors to extract, share, and annotate clippings of web- based visualizations during public visualization events. PixelClipper consists of an ambient display for showcasing clippings, a facilitated dis- play for an in-person discussion of clippings and visualizations, a clipping tool, and a website for storing and sharing clippings online. The article describes the design goals of PixelClipper, and the experiences from the deploying process and from a Pilot Event where PixelClipper has been used. \newline We wish to thank Pak Chung Wong for his guidance in producing this Special Issue and we also wish to thank the authors and reviewers for their hard work. We hope you enjoy reading these manuscripts and learn more about visualization in publication spaces.},

	abstract = {The goal of this project is to break Big Data barriers in numerical simulations to enable next-level flow and climate research. The sheer size and complexity of the simulation data overwhelms current storage systems and post-processing analysis tools, which leads to underutilized data and slows progress in flow and climate research. We will develop, implement and apply novel feature-based data analysis methods to be run alongside the simulation (in-situ), which condense the main aspects of the data by several orders of magnitude. This is accompanied by sophisticated task scheduling to exploit the heterogeneous hardware of modern supercomputers, and interactive visualization of the analysis results. For the first time, this will enable an interactive zoom into the smallest spatial and temporal scales of the largest flow and climate simulations. We apply our methods to target high-impact research questions. For the flow case, we address turbulent separation and wake-wake interactions; the former can directly lead to improved performance of vehicles and planes, the latter is crucial for the design of wind parks. For the climate case, we study the spatio-temporal development of extreme storms to assess the hazard posed to Sweden and other regions in Europe. Dissemination of our results is ensured by implementing our novel methods in a widely spread, open source in- situ library, and incorporating this library into three simulation packages actively used in Sweden.},

	abstract = {Large scale imaging and simulation is a common way to approach scientific problems. The consequence is the generation of data with increasing size and complexity with a need for robust and efficient data analysis methods to aid the domain experts in the scientific discovery process. However, many such techniques are developed in an ad hoc and heuristic manner. Techniques from computational topology provide robust methods for data analysis. However, to be useful in real world applications it is needed to link these concepts to semantic feature definitions in the application domain so that experts can make meaningful interpretations from the abstract representations. In this project, we will develop a pipeline for topological feature extraction, comparison, and tracking in two focus application areas relevant for the development of materials of the future. The first involves dynamic data from imaging in material research and the second is the study of data from molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Both data sources are challenging in terms of complexity and size. Starting with an appropriate topological representation of the data we will design methods for studying similarities and differences between data sets. Next, we will develop algorithms for extracting and tracking salient features over time, highlighting dynamical changes in the data. All developed methods will be integrated into an interactive visualization tool targeted at domain scientists.},

	abstract = {In this project we plan to perform research on topological data analysis with the goal to enable robust, multi-scale feature-tracking targeting guidance for the visual exploration of large-scale data sets to gain new insights into the dynamics of the data. The project is driven by scientific questions from selected applications in engineering, physics and medicine with increasing data complexity challenges. Our approach is to define descriptive data summaries on multiple scales, extending the idea of barcodes, which are given as feature vectors. We will establish feature evolution graphs through parameter spaces or time to highlight structural changes. The graphs will serve as the backbone of an interactive comparison and parameter space exploration. Starting with scalar fields the methods will be extended to less explored data types such as tensor fields and distributions . The development of robust and efficient algorithms will be a central theme. To reach the ambitious goals several fundamental questions have to be solved including the definition and investigation of appropriate interpolation methods and metrics in the space of tensors and distributions. The results will be implemented in a visual data analysis and exploration environment for scientific reasoning and interaction with the data.},

	abstract = {We present an interactive visual environment for linked analysis of brain imaging and clinical measurements. The environment is developed in an iterative participatory design process involving neuroscientists investigating the causes of brain-related complex diseases. Reasoning processes during the formation of hypotheses about correlations between active regions in the brain and physiological or psychological factors in studies with hundreds of subjects is a central part of the investigation. By observing the reasoning patterns behind hypotheses formation, we concluded that while existing tools provide powerful analysis options, they lack effective interactive exploration and are thus limiting the scientific scope and preventing extraction of knowledge from available data. Based on these observations, we designed methods that support neuroscientists by integrating their existing statistical analysis of multivariate subject data with interactive visual exploration to enable them to better understand differences between patient groups, and the complex bidirectional interplay between clinical measurement and the brain. These exploration concepts enable neuroscientists, for the first time during their investigations, to interactively move between and reason about questions such as `which clinical measurements are correlated with a specific brain region?' or `are there differences in brain activity between depressed young and old subjects?'. The environment uses parallel coordinates for effective overview of the subjects and selection of subject groups, Welch's t-test to filter out brain regions with statistically significant differences, and multiple visualizations of Pearson correlations between brain regions and clinical parameters to facilitate correlation analysis. A qualitative user study was performed with three neuroscientists from different domains. The study shows that the developed environment supports simultaneous analysis of more parameters, provides rapid pathways to insights, and is an effective support tool for hypothesis formation.},

Different sample placements have been used in previous work but they have not been compared with respect to their correctness or visual quality. In this work, the different sampling strategies are presented visually and practical implementation details are provided using algorithmic descriptions of each strategy. A thor- ough analysis based on comparisons with analytic solutions and real-world data shows that visual artifacts, especially at volume borders, can appear if samples are not placed correctly. Our analysis and comparison results in a sample placement strategy that easily can be integrated into existing implementations, has no impact on performance, and decreases visual artifacts of the rendered image compared to other fixed step size sample strategies.},

In this paper, we present a selection tool combining text-based queries with spatial selection and filtering. Morphological operations facilitate refinement of the selection by growing or shrinking operators, e.g.\ across covalent bonds. The combination of different selection paradigms enables flexible and intuitive analysis on different levels of detail and visual depiction of molecular events. Immediate visual feedback during interactions ensures a smooth exploration of the data. We demonstrate the utility of our selection framework by analyzing temporal changes in the secondary structure of poly-alanine and the binding of aspirin to phopholipase A2. },

	abstract = {The cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain and disturbed bowel habits, is largely un- known. It is believed to be related to physical properties in the gut, central mechanisms in the brain, psychological factors, or a combination of these. To understand the relationships within the gut-brain axis with respect to IBS, large numbers of measurements ranging from stool samples to functional mag- netic resonance imaging are collected from patients with IBS and healthy controls. As such, IBS is a typical example in medical research where research turns into a big data analysis challenge. In this chapter we demonstrate the power of interactive visual data analysis and exploration to generate an en- vironment for scientific reasoning and hypothesis formulation for data from multiple sources with different character. Three case studies are presented to show the utility of the presented work.},

In this chapter, we sample the visualization literature to provide a taxonomy of the usage of mathematics in visualization, and to identify a fundamental set of mathematics that should be taught to students as part of an introduction to contemporary visualization research. Within the scope of this chapter, we are unable to provide a full review of all mathematical foundations of visualization; rather, we identify a number of concepts that are useful in visualization, explain their significance, and provide references for further reading. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of linear algebra [90], multivariate calculus [89], statistics, combinatorics, and stochastics [39]. Other topics not covered in this chapter, such as image analysis [88], computer graphics [86], signal processing [41], computational geometry [18], geometric modeling, mesh generation, computer aided geometric design [35, 106], and numerics [76], can be found in well- established textbooks.

	abstract = {Topological feature analysis is a powerful instrument to understand the essential structure of a dataset. For such an instrument to be useful in applications, however, it is important to provide some importance measure for the extracted features that copes with the high feature density and discriminates spurious from important structures. Although such measures have been developed for scalar and vector fields, similar concepts are scarce, if not nonexistent, for tensor fields. In particular, the notion of robustness has been proven to successfully quantify the stability of topological features in scalar and vector fields. Intuitively, robustness measures the minimum amount of perturbation to the field that is necessary to cancel its critical points. This chapter provides a mathematical foundation for the construction of a feature hierarchy for 2D symmetric tensor field topology by extending the concept of robustness, which paves new ways for feature tracking and feature simplification of tensor field data. One essential ingredient is the choice of an appropriate metric to measure the perturbation of tensor fields. Such a metric must be well-aligned with the concept of robustness while still providing some meaningful physical interpretation. A second important ingredient is the index of a degenerate point of tensor fields, which is revisited and reformulated rigorously in the language of degree theory.},

	abstract = {In the field of organic electronics, understanding complex material morphologies and their role in efficient charge transport in solar cells is extremely important. Related processes are studied using the Ising model and Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations resulting in large ensembles of stochastic trajectories. Naive visualization of these trajectories, individually or as a whole, does not lead to new knowledge discovery through exploration. In this paper, we present novel visualization and exploration methods to analyze this complex dynamic data, which provide succinct and meaningful abstractions leading to scientific insights. We propose a morphology abstraction yielding a network composed of material pockets and the interfaces, which serves as backbone for the visualization of the charge diffusion. The trajectory network is created using a novel way of implicitly attracting the trajectories to the skeleton of the morphology relying on a relaxation process. Each individual trajectory is then represented as a connected sequence of nodes in the skeleton. The final network summarizes all of these sequences in a single aggregated network.We apply our method to three different morphologies and demonstrate its suitability for exploring this kind of data.},

	abstract = {We present an interactive approach to analyze flow fields using a new type of particle system, which is composed of autonomous particles exploring the flow. While particles provide a very intuitive way to visualize flows, it is a challenge to capture the important features with such systems. Particles tend to cluster in regions of low velocity and regions of interest are often sparsely populated. To overcome these disadvantages we propose an automatic adaption of the particle density with respect to local importance measures, which can be selected and the systems sensitivity to them interactively changed by the user. Together with the particle history these measures define a probability for particles to multiply or die respectively. There is no communication between the particles and no neighborhood information has to be maintained. Thus, the particles can be handled in parallel and support a real-time investigation of flow fields. To enhance the visualization, the particles properties and selected field measures are also used to specify the systems rendering parameters, as color and size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different, simulated vector fields from technical and medical applications.},

@inproceedings{Engelke2018,
	abstract = {In this work we explore evolutionary algorithms for selected visualization application. We demonstrate its potential using an example from flow visualization showing very promising first results.  Evolutionary algorithms, as guided search approach, find close-to-optimal solutions with respect to some fitness function in an iterative process using biologically motivated mechanisms like selection, mutation and recombination. As such, they provide a powerful alternative to filtering methods commonly used in visualization where the space of possible candidates is densely sampled in a preprocessing step from which the best candidates are then selected and visualized. This approach however tends to be increasingly inefficient with growing data size or expensive candidate computations resulting in large preprocessing times. We present an evolutionary algorithm for the problem of streamline selection to highlight features of interest in flow data. Our approach directly optimizes the solution candidates with respect to a user selected fitness function requiring significantly less computations. At the same time the problem of possible under-sampling is solved since we are not tied to a preset resolution. As first we consider a simple case with a two-dimensional seeding domain for the well-known flow around an obstacle. In the second example we extend the search space to three dimensions for a blood flow simulation in a cerebral aneurysm. For both examples the achieved results are similar to line filtering approaches with much less line computations.

	abstract = {Iso-surfaces or level-sets provide an effective and frequently used means for feature visualization. However, they are restricted to simple features for uni-variate data. The approach does not scale when moving to multi-variate data or when considering more complex feature definitions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \emph{traits} and \emph{feature level-sets}, which can be understood as a generalization of level-sets as it includes iso-surfaces, and fiber surfaces as special cases. The concept is applicable to a large class of traits defined as subsets in attribute space, which can be arbitrary combinations of points, lines, surfaces and volumes. Feature level-set are then initialized via distance fields in this space. The concept is implemented into a system that provides an interface to easily define traits in an interactive way and multiple rendering options. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using multi-variate data sets of different nature, including vector and tensor data, from different application domains.},

	abstract = {We present a visual exploration environment tailored for large-scale spatio-temporal molecular dynamics simulation data. The environment is referred to as VIA-MD (visual interactive analysis of molecular dynamics) and has been developed in a participatory design process with domain experts on molecular dynamics simulations of complex molecular systems. A key feature of our approach is the support for linked interactive 3D exploration of geometry and statistical analysis using dynamic temporal windowing and animation. Based on novel semantic level descriptions and hierarchical clustering of molecular properties we enable interactive filtering, which enables the user to effectively find spatial, temporal and statistical patterns. The VIA-MD environment provides an unprecedented tool for analysis of complex microscopic interactions hidden in large data volumes. We demonstrate the utility of the VIA-MD environment with four use cases. The first two deal with simulation of amyloid plaque associated with development of Alzheimer's, and we study an aqueous solution of 100 probes and an amyloid fibril. The identification of interaction "hotspots" is achieved with use of combined filter parameters connected with probe molecular planarity and probe--fibril interaction energetics. The third and fourth examples show the wide applicability of the environment by applying it to analysis of molecular properties in material design. },

	abstract = {Analyzing depressions plays an important role in meteorology, especially in the study of cyclones. In particular, the study of the temporal evolution of cyclones requires a robust depression tracking framework. To cope with this demand we propose a pipeline for the exploration of cyclones and their temporal evolution. This entails a generic framework for their identification and tracking. The fact that depressions and cyclones are not well-defined objects and their shape and size characteristics change over time makes this task especially challenging. Our method combines the robustness of topological approaches and the detailed tracking information from optical flow analysis. At first cyclones are identified within each time step based on well-established topological concepts. Then candidate tracks are computed from an optical flow field. These tracks are clustered within a moving time window to distill dominant coherent cyclone movements, which are then forwarded to a final tracking step. In contrast to previous methods our method requires only a few intuitive parameters. An integration into an exploratory framework helps in the study of cyclone movement by identifying smooth, representative tracks. Multiple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in tracking cyclones, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.},

Visualization capitalizes on the unprecedented human capacity to analyze visual information, as well as the rapid development of computer graphics technology that enables generation of images with ever increasing quality and speed. While visual exploration of scalar and vector data visualization techniques has proven to provide a global spatial understanding, analysis of complex and intricate structures of interest can become a major challenge. In this article, we show how data exploration and analysis can be further improved by adding haptics---force feedback that represents, and is derived from, the data. This combination of sensory information input leads to the notion of visuo-haptic visualization.},

	abstract = {Although turbulence suggests randomness and disorder, organized motions that cause spatiotemporal 'coherent structures' are of particular interest. Revealing such structures in numerically given turbulent or semi-turbulent flows is of interest both for practically working engineers and theoretically oriented physicists. However, as long as there is no common agreement about the mathematical definition of coherent structures, extracting such structures is a vaguely defined task. Instead of searching for a general definition, the data visualization community takes a pragmatic approach and provides various tool chains implemented in flexible software frameworks that allow the user to extract distinct flow field structures. Thus physicists or engineers can select those flow structures which might advance their insight best. We present different approaches to distill important features from turbulent flows and discuss the necessary steps to be taken on the example of Lagrangian coherent structures.},

@book{Schultz2017,
	abstract = {Starting from the entire Universe and all the way down to molecular length scales, physical quantities often take different values when observed along different directions. Directional dependence (anisotropy) of data is thus paramount to numerous scientific disciplines such as chemistry, material science, astrophysics, neuroscience, and medical imaging. Each of these disciplines has a wide collection of works that  employ tensors and other mathematical constructs introduced to represent anisotropy. The focus of this book is modeling, processing, and visualization of anisotropy irrespective of the context in which it emerges. As such, the present book differs substantially from conventional references that are centered around a particular application.  \newline This multidisciplinary book is the sixth in a series that aims to bolster scientific exchange between communities that employ tensors and other higher order representations of directionally-dependent data. A significant portion of the chapters were co-authored by the participants of the workshop titled ``Multidisciplinary Approaches to Multivalued Data: Modeling, Visualization, Analysis,'' which was held in Dagstuhl, Germany in April, 2016. The book is not a proceeding of the workshop though; some contributions deviate from the presentations at the workshop while addition of new material has enriched the content further. \newline The first four chapters of the book make up Part I whose focus is on characterizing features and visualizing fields of tensor fields. The following part includes a collection of chapters focusing on processing such data. Diffusion anisotropy continues to be a topic of interest. More fundamental aspects of the topic are addressed in the third part, and some important applications are presented in Part IV. In the final part, nascent approaches inspired by machine learning are included. \newline The visualization and analysis of data provides a necessary basis for the understanding and exploration of data, this is especially true and challenging when it comes to anisotropic or higher order entities. The first part of this book presents different strategies for a structural analysis of tensor data, which serve as basis for condensed multi-scale visualization. The methods range from  topological analysis, over statistical moments to the analysis of the gradient of tensors in materials. \newline The first chapter starts with theoretical considerations about the stability of topological structures with respect to perturbations in the tensor field. \newline The result is a feature hierarchy allowing a multi-scale analysis. The second chapter provides a more applied view on tensor topology and its interpretations in the context of solid mechanics simulations. A different view on structure is followed in the third chapter, which uses a moment invariants as descriptors of the tensor field. These descriptors are used to detect patterns in a data set independent on orientation and scale. The last chapter of the first part investigates the gradients of (symmetric) second order tensor fields, which are tensor of third order. Specific focus is put on stress gradients in structural mechanics for which a glyph based visualization is proposed. \newline Important sources of anisotropic data are various imaging methods, which result in voxelized data or unstructured point clouds. Analysis and processing of such data is the topic of the second part of the book.  The first step in analyzing discrete data is the choice of an appropriate interpolation schema, which is the topic of the first chapter. It provides a survey of interpolation schemes including a detailed analysis of their properties. The second chapter proposes a general framework for fundamental morphological operations such as dilation and erosion for matrix fields. The next two chapters deal with the analysis of point clouds. Chapter three proposes a robust extraction of geometrical shapes like curves and surfaces from point clouds even in noisy scenarios. It introduces an advanced Tensor Voting technique for blood vessel analysis. The last chapter uses a feature classification approach to extract and re-construct of point-sampled geometry of topographic data captured using airborne LiDAR technology. \newline Measuring structural anisotropy within locally oriented media is a challenging problem with enormous implications for assessing the state of neural tissues. Magnetic resonance techniques provide a powerful though indirect means for noninvasively measuring such anisotropy by characterizing the orientational preference of water diffusion. In the first chapter of Part III, the authors illustrate how anisotropy information can be obtained via diffusion MR. Various anisotropy metrics obtained through state-of-the-art signal-based and multicompartmental models are reviewed and compared with each other. The rather large voxels afforded by typical MR imaging studies complicate the determination of local (microscopic) anisotropy when there is significant heterogeneity within the voxel.  In a subsequent chapter, the notion of microscopic anisotropy and recent developments for its measurement via traditional as well as novel MR pulse sequences are reviewed. In the third chapter in this part, estimation of the single-diffusion tensor model in each voxel is revisited from a Bayesian perspective by incorporating heteroscedastic noise (i.e., that the variance does not have to be constant, but can change over the samples). In the last chapter, intra-voxel heterogeneity is modeled through a multi-compartmental model for diffusion MRI employing mixture of tensor-valued non-central Wishart distributions. \newliine Diffusion MRI fiber tractography remains the only available technique for mapping the brain's structural connectivity in vivo. The diverse contributions in part IV demonstrate that it also remains a topic of active research. The first chapter in this part introduces a novel method for obtaining a geometric representation of tract boundaries from streamline-based tractography via a curve similarity metric. A second chapter contributes to the validation of two widely used software packages for fiber tractography by investigating their test-retest reliability. The final chapter presents a pipeline for automated fiber bundle segmentation and quantification, which is specifically targeted towards the assessment of brain maturity in very preterm neonates.\newline In recent years, the broad use of deep learning approaches has significantly extended the state of the art in neighboring fields, such as computer vision. However, there has been relatively little work on adapting such techniques to tensor fields or other mathematical representations of anisotropy. Part V of our book includes two contributions to this timely field of research. The first explores the feasibility of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for mapping strain tensors to an associated scalar value. The second one uses CNNs to reconstruct fiber orientation distribution functions from diffusion MRI, which continues to work well even when reducing the number of measurements provided as input.

	abstract = {We present a visualization system for analyzing stochastic particle trajectory ensembles, resulting from Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations on charge transport in organic solar cells. The system supports the analysis of such trajectories in relation to complex material morphologies. It supports the inspection of individual trajectories or the entire ensemble on different levels of abstraction. Characteristic measures quantify the efficiency of the charge transport. Hence our system led to better understanding of ensemble trajectories by: (i) Capturing individual trajectory behavior and provide an ensemble overview; (ii) Enabling exploration through linked interaction between 3D representations and plots of characteristics measures; (iii) Discover potential traps in the material morphology; (iv) Study preferential paths. The visualization system became a central part in the research process. As such it continuously develops further along with the development of new hypothesis and questions from the application. Findings derived from the first visualizations, as e.g. new efficiency measures became new features of the system. Most of these features arose from discussions combining the data-perspective view from visualization with the physical background knowledge of the underlying processes. While our system has been built for a specific application the concepts translate to data sets for other stochastic particle simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a concept for interactive rendering of multiple data sets of varying type, including geometry, texutres or volume data, in one scene with correct transparency. Typical visualization applications involve multiple data fields from various sources. A thorough understanding of such data often requires combined rendering of theses fields. The choice of the visualization concepts, and thus the rendering techniques, depends on the context and type of the individual fields. Efficiently combining different techniques in one scene, however, is not always a straightforward task. We tackle this problem by using an A-buffer based approach to gather color and transparency information from different sources, combine them and generate the final output image. Thereby we put special emphasis on efficiency and low memory consumption to allow a smooth exploration of the data. Therefore, we compare different A-buffer implementations with respect to memory consumption and memory access pattern. Additionally we introduce an early-fragment-discarding heuristic using inter-frame coherence to speed up the rendering.},

Others have to be modified and some totally new methods have been developed over the past couple of years. This chapter gives an extended survey of this area. Surfaces and solids designed in a computer graphics environment have many applications in modeling, animation, and visualization. The chapter concentrates on the visualization part. The chapter starts with the basics from differential geometry, which are essential for any variational method. Then, it surveys on variational surface modeling. The last step is the visualization part of geometric modeling. In this context, surface curves like geodesies and curvature lines play an important role. The corresponding differential equations are nonlinear, and in most cases numerical algorithms must be used. To be sure to visualize features at a high quality, algorithms with an inherent quality control are needed. The chapter presents the geometric algorithms, which satisfy this demand.},

The visualization combines two major perspectives: Large scale trends based on a strongly simplified field as background visualization and a local visualization highlighting strongly expressed features at their exact position. Each component considers the vector field itself and its spatial derivatives. The derivate is an asymmetric tensor field, which allows the deduction of scalar quantities reflecting distinctive field properties like strength of rotation or shear. The basis of the background visualization is a vector and scalar clustering approach. The local features are defined as the extrema of the respective scalar fields. Applying scalar field topology provides a profound mathematical basis for the feature extraction. All design decisions are guided by the goal of generating a simple to read visualization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show results for three different data sets with different complexity and characteristics.},

@phdthesis{Hotz2003,
	abstract = {These theses consist basically of four relatively independent themes, that are however intimately connected in their origin. The first part presents a new geometrical algorithm for the computation of geodesics, that in contrast to standard methods allows a natural step length adaptation. Thus the number of points that have to be computed is significantly reduced without loss of quality. \newline This leads to efficient and accurate computation of geodesics. As an application, two approaches for the construction of local geodesic nets on surfaces are presented, which provide an intuitive visualization of surfaces. Surfaces with negative Gaussian curvature can be covered with a global network. For surfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, a regular net is restricted to the neighborhood of selected points. The computation of the nets is automatically restricted to this neighborhood. The representation of these networks in parameter space provides access to the surface properties, asymptotic directions in pseudo-orthogonal networks, even without mapping the embedded surface.  Geodetic polar coordinates also provide information about the shortest connections between points. \newline The second part expands the idea of using a geometrical method for the computation of surface curves to curvature lines, which are computed using a determinant criterion. In the direct neighborhood of umbilical points, the error is controlled by adaptation of the step length. The advantage of this approach in comparison to the common methods is not as significant as for the computation of the geodesics. But the geometrical meaning of the determinant leads beside the computation of the curvature line also to other interesting applications.  Using curvature lines to cover a surface with a net, umbilical points determine the topology of this net. The investigation of the zeros of the determinant in the umbilical points leads to easy classification of the umbilical points. \newline The topic of the third part is isometric embeddings as a visualization approach for abstract metrics. Abstract metrics play an important role, especially in general relativity. Until now there is no satisfying solution to this problem for an arbitrary metric. A new algorithmic approach is build up from two parts: a distance estimation of points on the surface and the re-construction of the surface from these distances. In contrast to other methods, there are no principal restrictions to the metric. Surfaces with arbitrary Gaussian curvature can be treated. The algorithm solves the problem of ambiguity, which appears in other approaches computing the surface based on point distances. A further advantage is the possibility of local embeddings if there is no global solution exists. By a given error tolerance one has control over the maximum error. Other than for numerical approaches no appropriate initial surface is required. However, the method presented here does not allow predefined boundary conditions or special surface topology. The embedding algorithm is evaluated by well-known surfaces and then the influence of errors on the results is investigated. \newline The main problem concerning the embedding of surfaces with arbitrary metrics is the global existence of the embedding on small changes of the metric. Often we need many patches to cover the whole parameter space. In general, these surfaces cannot be put smoothly together. This means the main goal is to find a balance between an accepted error and the number of required surface patches. \newline In relation to this problem, a discrete definition of curvature is discussed, that uses a simple solution useful especially for the application of the surface embedding algorithm. The problem of the choice of an appropriate interpolation of tensor data is demonstrated in some examples. \newline The last part of the thesis is the original motivation for me to deal with abstract metrics. It arises for a new idea for tensor-field visualization. The basic idea is to put symmetrical tensor-fields in a geometrical context by interpreting them as a distortion of a flat metric. This leads to an abstract metric definition. In the next step, the thus defined metric is visualized by an isometric embedding. The distances of neighboring points are a measure for the tensor value in this direction. The deformation of the coordinate frame in this mapping allows an interpretation of the tensor field. The separation of the coordinate lines in a special direction points to positive eigenvalues. The basis for this method is the isometric embedding of the metric.},

Our primary interest is the tool itself. We demonstrate that a user wielding this tool can find ways to improve the performance of an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm as applied to a problem of finding 3D paths in the presence of impediments [14]. One part of a solution method can be to find a path on a grid. Of course, there are near linear time algorithms for the shortest path that have been applied to problems that are quite large. However, for a grid in three dimensions with arcs on the axes and diagonals, the problems can become extremely large as resolution is increased and heuristics thus make sense (see, e.g., [6] for state-of-the art algorithms where pre-processing is possible). Ant colony optimization (see, e.g., [4,5]) is ideally suited to such a problem.},

@misc{Hotz2005B,
	abstract = {Many applications in geophysics involve computing not only scalar and vector fields but also tensor fields.  Examples include projecting the postseismic stress change from one fault onto nearby faults to assess seismic hazard, and calculation of stress in geodynamical models of time-dependent damage. The graphical representation of data and models, however, is typically restricted to either scalar fields, such as a damage parameter, vector fields, such as velocity, or to representation of tensors at isolated points, such as earthquake focal mechanism. But there is much more information contained in the tensor fields. For continuous three-dimensional complex datasets it may not be obvious which locations to choose and thus the exploration of the entire data set is very cumbersome. A visualization method giving an intuitive overview of the tensor field allows an effective detection of interesting regions, which than can be investigated with classical methods. \newline We have developed a tensor field visualization method providing a continuous representation. The basic idea is to bend, stretch, and compress a fabric-like texture, that is dense in regions of compression and sparse in regions of expansion. The texture parameters, i.e., fiber density and fiber direction, are controlled by the tensor field. The texture is composed of two families of fibers, generated using line integral convolution (LIC). This method uses a random noise image as input that is blurred along a direction field, in our case the principal directions of the tensor field. A regular, homogeneous input image with circular spots results in fibers with constant density and fiber width. The impression of stretching or compressing can be achieved by changing density, shape, and size of the spots. \newline Like most texture-based methods, this approach is basically limited to two dimensions due to occlusion problems. To be able to explore the entire three-dimensional volume, we define a one-parameter family of surfaces such that the union of the surfaces covers the entire domain. In our implementation, we support two ways to define such surfaces. The first possibility is to define the surfaces explicitly, based on a geometric property or symmetry inherent to the structure of the data. Simple possibilities are "moving planes", cylinders, or parts of spheres.  More complex surfaces defined by faults or moving objects like hot buoyant fluid sphere rising in a colder matrix, can also be used.  The second option is to define the surfaces implicitly using isosurfaces of an additional connected scalar field, e.g., pressure, temperature, or damage. \newline In the final visualization we show the deformed fabric-texture on a surface moving through the volume. To compute the textures on the surfaces we project the tensor field onto the surfaces. We provide two ways of looking at these surfaces. The first uses volume rendering based on a transfer function illustrating the volume only in a small neighborhood of the chosen isovalue. The second approach is an explicit extraction and visualization of the surfaces. The most expensive part of the texture generation is the computation of the input spot image for the convolution step. This computation can be done in a pre-processing step. The three-dimensional domain can thus be examined easily using different sets of surfaces. This method supports an intuitive representation of a tensor field and supports the additional visualization of a connected scalar field.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the extraction of the surface topology of tensor fields on 2D triangulated manifolds embedded in 3D. In scientific visualization topology is a meaningful instrument to get a hold on the structure of a given dataset. Due to the discontinuity of tensor fields on a piecewise planar domain, standard topology extraction methods result in an incomplete topological skeleton. In particular with regard to the high computational costs of the extraction this is not satisfactory. This paper provides a method for topology extraction of tensor fields that leads to complete results. The core idea is to include the locations of discontinuity into the topological analysis. For this purpose the model of continuous transition bridges is introduced, which allows to capture the entire topology on the discontinuous field. The proposed method is applied to piecewise linear three-dimensional tensor fields defined on the vertices of the triangulation and for piecewise constant two or three-dimensional tensor fields given per triangle, e.g. rate of strain tensors of piecewise linear flow fields.},

	abstract = {Vector field visualization approaches can broadly be categorized into approaches that directly visualize local or integrated flow and approaches that analyze the topological structure and visualize extracted features. Our goal was to come up with a method that falls into the first category, yet reveals structural information. We have developed a dense flow visualization method that shows the overall flow behavior while accentuating structural information without performing a topological analysis. Our method is based on a geometry-based flow integration step and a texture-based visual exploration step. The flow integration step generates a density field, which is written into a texture. The density field is generated by tracing particles under the influence of the underlying vector field. When using a quasi-random seeding strategy for initialization, the resulting density is high in attracting regions and low in repelling regions. Density is measured by the number of particles per region accumulated over time. We generate one density field using forward and one using backward propagation. The density fields are explored using texture-based rendering techniques. We generate the two output images separately and blend the results, which allows us to distinguish between inflow and outflow regions. We obtained dense flow visualizations that display the overall flow behavior, emphasize critical and separating regions, and indicate flow direction in the neighborhood of these regions. We have test our method for isolated first-order singularities and real data sets.},

FEM theory further provides a well-founded theory to prove the efficiency of the presented algorithm via convergence analysis. We, therefore, compare the convergence behavior of our method against uniform subdivisions and a refinement scheme that was presented in the context of CPU volume ray-casting.

Originally developed for images and scalar fields, pattern matching methods become increasingly interesting for other applications, e.g., vector fields. To apply pattern matching to vector fields the basic concepts of convolution and fast Fourier transform (FFT) have to be generalized to vector fields. A formalism supporting an elegant generalization of these concepts is provided by the Clifford Algebra, originally developed for describing geometry and geometric operations. We discuss an application of the Clifford Pattern Matching (CPM). We apply CPM to images for "Clifford Color Edge Detection" (C2 ED), an approach for detecting edges and other features in color images. The basic idea is to treat color value tripels as vectors and apply the pattern matching algorithm to the resulting vector values filters for edge detection and present results.},

The resulting partial differential equations have no standard solution. Only for some special cases satisfactory methods are known. I present a new algorithmic approach which is not based on differential equations. In contrast to other methods this technique also works if the embedding exists only locally. The fundamental idea is to estimate Euclidean distances, from which the surface is built up. In this paper I focus on the reconstruction of a surface from these estimated distances. Particular the influence of a perturbation of the distances on the shape of the resulting surface is investigated.},

We propose a novel algorithm that efficiently extracts the Morse-Smale complex based on algorithms from discrete Morse theory. The proposed algorithm is thereby optimal with a computational complexity of O(n2). The per- sistence is then computed using the Morse-Smale complex by applying an existing algorithm with a good practical running time.

	abstract = {One of the main research topics in scientific visualization is to ``vi- sualize the appropriate features'' of a certain structure or data set. Geodesics are very important in geometry and physics, but there is one major problem which prevents scientists from using them as a visualization tool: The differential equations for geodesics are very complicated and in most cases numerical algorithms must be used. There is always a certain approximation error involved. How can you be sure to visualize the features and not only the approximation quality. We present here an algorithm to overcome this problem. This paper consists of two parts. In the first, a geometric method for the construction of geodesics of arbitrary surfaces is introduced. This method is based on the fundamental property that geodesics are a generalization of straight lines on plains. In the second part these geodesics are used to generate local nets on the surfaces.},

While most data from simulations or experiments are discrete many visualization methods are based on smooth, continuous data approximation or interpolation methods. We introduce a new interpolation method for symmetrical tensor fields given on a triangulated domain. Differently from standard tensor field interpolation, which is based on the tensor components, we use tensor invariants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, for the interpolation. This interpolation minimizes the number of eigenvectors and eigenvalues computations by restricting it to mesh vertices and makes an exact integration of the tensor lines possible. The tensor field topology is qualitatively the same as for the component wise-interpolation. Since the interpolation decouples the ``shape'' and ``direction'' interpolation it is shape-preserving, what is especially important for tracing fibers in diffusion MRI data.},

Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method.

Existing visualization methods for tensor fields only cover a fraction of the broad application areas. We present a visualization method tailored specifically to the class of tensor field exhibiting properties similar to stress and strain tensors, which are commonly encountered in geomechanics. Our technique is a global method that represents the physical meaning of these tensor fields with their central features: regions of compression or expansion. The method is based on two steps: first, we define a positive definite metric, with the same topological structure as the tensor field; second, we visualize the resulting metric. The eigenvector fields are represented using a texture-based approach resembling line integral convolution (LIC) methods. The eigenvalues of the metric are encoded in free parameters of the tex- ture definition. Our method supports an intuitive distinction between positive and negative eigenvalues. We have applied our method to synthetic and some standard data sets, and ``real'' data from Earth science and mechanical engineering application.},

Existing tracking algorithms such as Feature Flow Fields apply numerical schemes utilizing derivatives of the data, which makes them prone to noise and involve a large number of computational parameters. In contrast, our method is robust against noise since it does not require derivatives, interpolation, and numerical integration. Furthermore, we propose an importance measure that combines the spatial persistence of a critical point with its temporal evolution. This leads to a time-aware feature hierarchy, which allows us to discriminate important from spurious features. Our method requires only a single, easy-to-tune computational parameter and is naturally formulated in an out-of-core fashion, which enables the analysis of large data sets.

Each source provides an additional perspective on the phenomenon of interest, but also comes with specific limitations, e.g. regarding accuracy, spatial and temporal availability. Effectively combining and analyzing such multimodal and partially incomplete data of limited accuracy in an integrated way is challenging. In this work, we outline an approach for an integrated analysis and visualization of the atmospheric impact of volcano eruptions. The data sets comprise observation and imaging data from satellites as well as results from numerical particle simulations. To analyze the clouds from the volcano eruption in the spatiotemporal domain we apply topological methods. Extremal structures reveal structures in the data that support clustering and comparison. We further discuss the robustness of those methods with respect to different properties of the data and different parameter setups. Finally we outline open challenges for the effective integrated visualization using topological methods.},

In the theory of exterior calculus on a Riemannian manifold, the Laplace-Beltrami operator of a surface is a special case of the Hodge Laplacian which acts on r-forms, i. e. the Hodge Laplacian on 0-forms (functions) is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We investigate the usefulness of the heat kernel of the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms (which can be seen as the vector Laplacian) to derive new point signatures which are invariant under isometric mappings. A similar approach used to obtain the HKS yields a symmetric tensor field of second order; for easier comparability we consider several scalar tensor invariants. Computed examples show that these new point signatures are especially interesting for surfaces with boundary.},

The HKS is derived from the heat kernel and was originally introduced as an isometry invariant shape signature. The time parameter of the heat kernel allows a multiscale analysis in a natural way. By considering a positive definite tensor field as a Riemannian metric the definition of the HKS can be applied directly. To investigate how this measure can be used to visualize more general tensor fields we apply mappings to obtain positive definite tensor fields. The resulting scalar quantity is used for the visualization of tensor fields. For short times it is closely related to Gaussian curvature, i. e. it is quite different to usual tensor invariants like the trace or the determinant.},

Due to its robustness, isometry invariance, and multiscale nature, it has been successfully applied in many geometric applications. From a more general point of view, the HKS can be considered as a descriptor of the metric of a Riemannian manifold. Given a symmetric positive definite tensor field we may interpret it as the metric of some Riemannian manifold and thereby apply the HKS to visualize and analyze the given tensor data. In this paper, we propose a generalization of this approach that enables the treatment of indefinite tensor fields, like the stress tensor, by interpreting them as a generator of a positive definite tensor field. To investigate the usefulness of this approach we consider the stress tensor from the two-point-load model example and from a mechanical work piece.},

	abstract = {Virtual testing is an integral part of modern product development in mechanical engineering. Numerical structure simulations allow the computation of local stresses which are given as tensor fields. For homogeneous materials, the tensor information is usually reduced to a scalar field like the von Mises stress. A material-dependent threshold defines the material failure answering the key question of engineers. This leads to a rather simple feature-based visualisation. For composite materials like short fiber reinforced polymers, the situation is much more complex. The material property is determined by the fiber distribution at every position, often de- scribed as fiber orientation tensor field. Essentially, the material's ability to cope with stress becomes anisotropic and inhomogeneous. We show how to combine the stress field and the fiber orientation field in such cases, leading to a feature-based visualization of tensor fields for composite materials. The resulting features inform the en- gineer about potential improvements in the product development.},

@article{Jankowai2019,
	abstract = {In this work, we propose a controlled simplification strategy for degenerated points in symmetric 2D tensor fields that is based on the topological notion of robustness. Robustness measures the structural stability of the degenerate points with respect to variation in the underlying field. We consider an entire pipeline for generating a hierarchical set of degenerate points based on their robustness values. Such a pipeline includes the following steps: the stable extraction and classification of degenerate points using an edge labeling algorithm, the computation and assignment of robustness values to the degenerate points, and the construction of a simplification hierarchy. We also discuss the challenges that arise from the discretization and interpolation of real world data. \newline Topological feature analysis is a powerful instrument to understand the essential structure of a dataset. For such an instrument to be useful in applications, however, it is important to provide some importance measure for the extracted features that copes with the high feature density and discriminates spurious from important structures. Although such measures have been developed for scalar and vector fields, similar concepts are scarce, if not nonexistent, for tensor fields. In particular, the notion of robustness has been proven to successfully quantify the stability of topological features in scalar and vector fields. Intuitively, robustness measures the minimum amount of perturbation to the field that is necessary to cancel its critical points. This chapter provides a mathematical foundation for the construction of a fea- ture hierarchy for 2D symmetric tensor field topology by extending the concept of robustness, which paves new ways for feature tracking and feature simplification of tensor field data. One essential ingredient is the choice of an appropriate metric to measure the perturbation of tensor fields. Such a metric must be well-aligned with the concept of robustness while still providing some meaningful physical interpretation. A second important ingredient is the index of a degenerate point of tensor fields, which is revisited and reformulated rigorously in the language of degree theory.},

We propose a novel TF design toolbox based on color similarity which is used to adjust opacity as well as replacing colors. We show that both CIE L*u*v* chromaticity and the chroma component of YCBCR are equally suited as underlying color space for the TF widgets. In order to maximize the area utilized in the TF editor, we renormalize the color space based on the histogram of the dataset. Thereby, colors representing a higher share of the dataset are depicted more prominently, thus providing a higher sensitivity for fine-tuning TF widgets. The applicability of our TF design toolbox is demonstrated by volume ray casting challenging full-color volume data including the visible male cryosection dataset and examples from 3D histology.},

	abstract = {We propose an efficient algorithm that computes the Morse-Smale complex for 3D gray-scale images. This complex allows for an efficient computation of persistent homology since it is, in general, much smaller than the input data but still contains all necessary information. Our method improves a recently proposed algorithm to extract the Morse-Smale complex in terms of memory consumption and running time. It also allows for a parallel computation of the complex. The computational complexity of the Morse-Smale complex extraction solely depends on the topological complexity of the input data. The persistence is then computed using the Morse-Smale complex by applying an existing algorithm with a good practical running time. We demonstrate that our method allows for the computation of persistent homology for large data on commodity hardware.},

	abstract = {We present a practical approach to generate stochastic anisotropic samples with Poisson-disk characteristic over a two-dimensional domain. In contrast to isotropic samples, we understand anisotropic samples as non-overlapping ellipses whose size and density match a given anisotropic metric. Anisotropic noise samples are useful for many visualization and graphics applications. The spot samples can be used as input for texture generation, e.g., line integral convolution (LIC), but can also be used directly for visualization. The definition of the spot samples using a metric tensor makes them especially suitable for the visualization of tensor fields that can be translated into a metric. Our work combines ideas from sampling theory and mesh generation. To generate these samples with the desired properties we construct a first set of non-overlapping ellipses whose distribution closely matches the underlying metric. This set of samples is used as input for a generalized anisotropic Lloyd relaxation to distribute noise samples more evenly. Instead of computing the Voronoi tessellation explicitly, we introduce a discrete approach, which combines the Voronoi cell and centroid computation in one step. Our method supports automatic packing of the elliptical samples, resulting in textures similar to those generated by anisotropic reaction-diffusion methods. We use Fourier analysis tools for quality measurement of uniformly distributed samples.},

	abstract = {Tensors provide a powerful language to describe physical phenomena. Consequently, they have a long tradition in physics and appear in various application areas, either as the final result of simulations or as intermediate product. Due to their complexity, tensors are hard to interpret. This motivates the development of well-conceived visualization methods. As a sub-branch of scientific visualization, tensor field visualization has been especially pushed forward by diffusion tensor imaging. In this review, we focus on second-order tensors that are not diffusion tensors. Until now, these tensors, which might be neither positive-definite nor symmetric, are underrepresented in visualization and existing visualization tools are often not appropriate for these tensors. Hence, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods when dealing with such tensors as well as challenges introduced by them. The goal of this paper is to reveal the importance of the field and to encourage the development of new visualizationmethods for tensors from various application fields.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for the generation of anisotropic sample distributions on planar and two-manifold domains. Most previous work that is concerned with aperiodic point distributions is designed for isotropically shaped samples. Methods focusing on anisotropic sample distributions are rare, and either they are restricted to planar domains, are highly sensitive to the choice of parameters, or they are computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a time-efficient approach for the generation of anisotropic sample distributions that only depends on intuitive design parameters for planar and two-manifold domains. We employ an anisotropic triangulation that serves as basis for the creation of an initial sample distribution as well as for a gravitational-centered relaxation. Furthermore, we present an approach for interactive rendering of anisotropic Voronoi diagrams as base element for texture generation. It represents a novel and flexible visualization approach to depict metric tensor fields that can be derived from general tensor fields as well as scalar or vector fields.},

It showcases how interdisciplinary work can lead to new insight and progress in both fields. Our case is concerned with one step in the product development process. Its goal is the design of mechanical parts that are functional, meet required quality measures and can be manufactured with standard production methods. The collaboration started with unspecific goals and first experiments with the available data and visualization methods. During the course of the collaboration many concrete questions arose and in the end a hypothesis was developed which will be discussed and evaluated in this paper. We facilitate a case study to validate our hypothesis. For the case study we con- sider the design of a reinforcement structure of a brake lever, a plastic ribbing. Three new lever geometries are developed on basis of our hypothesis and are compared against each other and against a reference model. The validation comprises standard numerical and experimental tests. In our case, all new structures outperform the reference geometry. The results are very promising and suggest potential to impact the product development process also for more complex scenarios.},

	abstract = {Many of the recently developed methods for analysis and visualization of time-dependent flows are related to concepts, which can be subsumed under the term Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). Thereby, no universal definition of LCS ex- ists and different interpretations are used. Mostly, LCS are considered to be features linked to pathlines leading to the ideal conception of features building material lines. Such time-dependent features are extracted by averaging local properties of particles along their trajectories, e.g., separation, acceleration or unsteadiness. A popular realization of LCS is the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) with its different implementations. The goal of this paper is to stimulate a discussion on the generality of the underlying assumptions and concepts. Using a few well-known datasets, the interpretation and usability of Lagrangian analysis methods are discussed.},

We formulate Forman's theory in a graph theoretic setting and provide a simple algorithm for the construction and topological simplification of combinatorial vector fields on 2D manifolds. Given a combinatorial vector field we are able to extract its topological skeleton including all periodic orbits. Due to the solid theoretical foundation we know that the resulting structure is always topologically consistent. We explore the applicability and limitations of this combinatorial approach with several examples and determine its robustness with respect to noise.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approximation algorithm for the fundamental graph problem of combinatorial vector field topology (CVT). CVT is a combinatorial approach based on a sound theoretical basis given by Forman's work on a discrete Morse theory for dynamical systems. A computational framework for this mathematical model of vector field topology has been developed recently. The applicability of this framework is however severely limited by the quadratic complexity of its main computational kernel. In this work we present an approximation algorithm for CVT with a significantly lower complexity. This new algorithm reduces the runtime by several orders of magnitude, and maintains the main advantages of CVT over the continuous approach. Due to the simplicity of our algorithm it can be easily parallelized to improve the runtime further.},

	abstract = {Acceleration is a fundamental quantity of flow fields that captures Galilean invariant properties of particle motion. Considering the magnitude of this field, minima represent characteristic structures of the flow that can be classified as saddle- or vortex-like. We made the interesting observation that vortex-like minima are enclosed by particularly pronounced ridges. This makes it possible to define boundaries of vortex regions in a parameter-free way. Utilizing scalar field topology, a robust algorithm can be designed to extract such boundaries. They can be arbitrarily shaped. An efficient tracking algorithm allows us to display the temporal evolution of vortices. Various vortex models are used to evaluate the method. We apply our method to two-dimensional model systems from computational fluid dynamics and compare the results to those arising from existing definitions.},

	abstract = {Blood flow data from direct measurements (4D flow MRI) or numerical simulations opens new possibilities for the understanding of the development of cardiac diseases. However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for cross- sectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching off clusters reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map.

Their independence from certain transformations makes them a powerful tool for the recognition of patterns and shapes. It has recently been demonstrated that the basic ideas can also be transferred to vector valued functions. Vector moment invariants can be used to define and search for interesting flow structures. A generalization to three-dimensional vector valued functions so far has not been investigated at all. In this paper, we approach that problem. We introduce a definition of moments for three-dimensional vector fields and present how flow field invariants can be constructed from the normalization of the first order vector moment tensor.},

	abstract = {he analysis of 2D flow data is often guided by the search for characteristic structures with semantic meaning. One way to approach this question is to identify structures of interest by a human observer, with the goal of finding similar structures in the same or other datasets. The major challenges related to this task are to specify the notion of similarity and define respective pattern descriptors. While the descriptors should be invariant to certain transformations, such as rotation and scaling, they should provide a similarity measure with respect to other transformations, such as deformations. In this paper, we propose to use moment invariants as pattern descriptors for flow fields. Moment invariants are one of the most popular techniques for the description of objects in the field of image recognition. They have recently also been applied to identify 2D vector patterns limited to the directional properties of flow fields. Moreover, we discuss which transformations should be considered for the application to flow analysis. In contrast to previous work, we follow the intuitive approach of moment normalization, which results in a complete and independent set of translation, rotation, and scaling invariant flow field descriptors. They also allow to distinguish flow features with different velocity profiles. We apply the moment invariants in a pattern recognition algorithm to a real world dataset and show that the theoretical results can be extended to discrete functions in a robust way.},

Early inspection and analysis of on-going large simulations enables domain experts to obtain first insight into their running simulation process and intermediate results. Compared to conventional post-processing, such in-situ processing has the advantage of keeping data in memory, avoiding to store the large amount of raw data to disk, providing on-the-fly analysis, and preventing early failures in the simulation process. In this poster we present a distributed and scalable software infrastructure, which provides distributed in-situ data processing, feature extraction and interactive exploration at user's front-end. We have integrated and extended our system to multiple simulation applications, ranging from Lattice-Boltzmann blood flow simulation to grid based simulation  for propulsion systems. A user-interactive front-end is integrated
to our system, allowing to directly interact with the visualization of running simulations, gain insight, and make decisions.},

Thus, the simulation output can yield dataset sizes of many terabytes. An efficient analysis and visualization process becomes very difficult especially for explorative scenar- ios where users continuously change input parameters. Using a distributed rendering pipeline may relieve the visualization frontend considerably but is often not sufficient. Therefore, we additionally propose a progressive data streaming and rendering approach. The main contribution of our method is the importance-guided order of data processing for block structured datasets. This requires a dynamic scheduling of data chunks on the paral- lel post-processing system which has been implemented by using an R-Tree. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of our implementation for view-dependent feature extraction with varying viewpoints.},

Due to this generality they occur in various application areas, either as result or intermediate product of simulations. As different as these applications, is the physical meaning and relevance of particular mathematical properties. In this context, domain specific tensor invariants that describe the entities of interest play a crucial role. Due to their importance, we propose to build any tensor visualization upon a set of carefully chosen tensor invariants. In this chapter we focus on glyph-based representations, which still belong to the most frequently used tensor visualization methods. For the effectiveness of such visualizations the right choice of glyphs is essential. This chapter summarizes some common glyphs, mostly with origin in mechanical engineering, and link their interpretation to specific tensor invariants.},

	abstract = {The engineer is supported for the design of ribbed plastic components by basic guidelines concerning the shape and the position of the ribs. Thus, the experience and intuition of the individual engineer plays an important role. For this reason, a plastics component with an optimal rib structure cannot be guaranteed. To ensure an appropriate rib structure for given loading conditions iterative procedures are applied in practice. In this publication a new strategy is presented as an assistance for the design of ribbed plastic components. The investigated tensor lines (lines tangential to the principal stresses) are related to the major load paths between the application of loads and the fixation points of a component. Hence, tensor lines can be considered as a central component in the structure design process. The guidance of the design of rib structures in injection molded plastic parts by selected tensor lines will result in an optimized rib structure which leads to stiffer parts when identical material is used. FE-simulations as well as experimental tests validate the optimization potential of tensor line visualization for the design of ribbed plastic components.},

	abstract = {Today, product development processes in mechanical engineering are almost entirely carried out via computer-aided simulations. One essential output of these simulations are stress tensors, which are the basis for the dimensioning of the technical parts. The tensors contain information about the strength of internal stresses as well as their principal directions. However, for the analysis they are mostly reduced to scalar key metrics. The motivation of this work is to put the tensorial data more into focus of the analysis and demonstrate its potential for the product development process. In this context we resume a visualization method that has been introduced many years ago, tensor lines. Since tensor lines have been rarely used in visualization applications, they are mostly considered as physically not relevant in the visualization community. In this paper we challenge this point of view by reporting two case studies where tensor lines have been applied in the process of the design of a technical part. While the first case was a real success, we could not reach similar results for the second case. It became clear that the first case cannot be fully generalized to arbitrary settings and there are many more questions to be answered before the full potential of tensor lines can be realized. In this chapter, we review our success story and our failure case and discuss some directions of further research.},
